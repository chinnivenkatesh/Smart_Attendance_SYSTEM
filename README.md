# Smart_Attendance_SYSTEM
A real-time attendance system built with Python, Flask, OpenCV, and face_recognition. This project captures faces through a webcam, compares them with pre-registered images, and automatically marks attendance. It features duplicate detection, dynamic user registration, and stores attendance logs with date and time in a database.
